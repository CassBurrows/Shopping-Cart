# Shopping Cart
This was an exercise done through the MIT x Pro course, to demonstrate backend and front end functionality using an API.

# How to Run
Open the .html file in a local host and edit the cart.

# Future Improvements
I believe I could change the overall design, and add further pages to create a better "shopping" experience with this.
